                    <h3>Gun, Snake, and Water Game</h3>
                    <p>
                        The "Gun, Snake, and Water Game" is a Python-based project inspired by the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. In this fun and interactive game, players choose one of three options—Gun, Snake, or Water—to compete against the computer. Each choice has specific interactions: Gun beats Snake, Snake drinks Water, and Water defeats Gun. The game is designed with simple logic, making it a great demonstration of Python’s basics, including random choices, conditionals, and user input.

                    <h3>My Powered Virtual Assistant</h3>
                    <p>
                        Jarvis is a Python-based virtual assistant built to follow voice commands and perform tasks efficiently. Designed as a helpful tool, Jarvis responds to user instructions like:
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Hey Jarvis, open Google" – Instantly opens Google in a browser.</li>
                            <li>"Hey Jarvis, open YouTube" – Launches YouTube for quick access.</li>
                            <li>"Hey Jarvis, play YouTube songs" – Searches and plays songs on YouTube automatically.</li>
                        </ul>
                        This project showcases my ability to use Python for automation and integrate voice command functionality to create interactive tools.
