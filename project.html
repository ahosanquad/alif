                <h3>Gun, Snake, and Water Game</h3>

                <p>The "Gun, Snake, and Water Game" is a Python-based project inspired by the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. In this fun and interactive game, players choose one of three options—Gun, Snake, or Water—to compete against the computer. Each choice has specific interactions: Gun beats Snake, Snake drinks Water, and Water defeats Gun. The game is designed with simple logic, making it a great demonstration of Python’s basics, including random choices, conditionals, and user input. It’s a fun addition to any portfolio, showcasing creativity and foundational programming skills.
